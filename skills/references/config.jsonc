Use this default `ataski/config.jsonc` when a project has not customized Ataski:

```json
{
  "structure": {
    "0": "todo/",
    "1": "in-progress/",
    "2": "done/"
  },
  "taskID": {
    "prefix": "T",
    "length": 3,
    "example": "T001"
  },
  "taskFrontMatter": {
    "id": "The task ID",
    "title": "The task title",
    "status": "The task status",
    "blockedBy": "Array of task IDs that must be done before this task can start",
    "owner": "Optional current owner/agent",
    "created_at": "The task creation datetime",
    "updated_at": "The task update datetime"
  },
  "testStrategy": "Red/Green TDD",
  "tracker": "tasks.md",
  "worktreesDir": "ataski/worktrees/"
}
```

`worktreesDir` is the git worktree root. By default, the canonical worktree and all task worktrees live under `ataski/worktrees/`, and that directory should be git-ignored.
